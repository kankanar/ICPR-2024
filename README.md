# ICPR-2024
This is the code for my ICPR 2024 paper titled ["Hand over face gesture classification with Feature
driven vision transformer and supervised
contrastive learning"]. I hope you find this useful 
# Proposed Algorithm

The proposed algorithm in the paper ["Hand over face gesture classification with Feature
driven vision transformer and supervised
contrastive learning"] has two major steps. The end goal of our algorithm is to perform hand over face (HOF) gesture recognition.
First we perform a contrastive learning using TResNet-L with supervised contrastive loss. 
In the second step we we use our proposed model feature driven transformer with the pre-trained TResNet encoder for final training on classification.
Please see the figure for complete model understanding.
